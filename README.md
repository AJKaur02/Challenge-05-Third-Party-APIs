# Challenge-05-Third-Party-APIs

This project implements a basic Kanban board using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It allows users to:

* **Create new tasks:** Add tasks with titles, descriptions, and optional due dates.
* **Manage task flow:** Drag and drop tasks between three lanes representing different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
* **Visualize progress:** See the current status of tasks at a glance.
* **Persistent storage:** Tasks and next task ID are saved in localStorage for future sessions.

### Features:

* **Drag and drop functionality:** Move tasks between lanes to reflect progress.
* **Due date visualization:** Task cards highlight based on due date proximity for better awareness.
* **Delete tasks:** Remove completed tasks from the board.

### Prerequisites:

* Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Node.js and npm installed (optional for running the project locally).
